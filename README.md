# CS171 Final Project - Matt Roth and Tadhg Looram

## Project Description
A year after the Taliban came to power, it seems like most of the world has forgotten about Afghanistan and its people.

Our project revisits this time period and looks into how the takeover unraveled, what were the immediate and longer lasting consequences for the Afghan people.

This project serves as a reminder of what happened in Afghanistan and of the ongoing suffering. We hope that bringing awareness to this humanitarian crisis will encourage you the viewers to support the people of Afghanistan in any way you can.
